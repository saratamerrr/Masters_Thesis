Decision quality is another important variable for any research involving group decision-making. Decision quality-related issues (overall quality and idea quality) have been examined most frequently by researchers in the GSS area between 1982 and mid-1998 [20], an indication of the importance of this category of variables in group decision-making. Decision quality can be assessed by comparing the outcome of group work with a correct or desired solution for certain categories of group tasks, such as intellective tasks. However, unlike intellective tasks, decision-making and cognitive-conflict tasks do not have any correct outcome [48] . Yet decision quality as perceived by the participants is an important dependent variable for these types of group work. Perceived decision quality includes group members' confidence in the decision outcome and their perceptions of the usefulness of the decision outcome [24]. Satisfaction with the decision-making process is the most widely studied satisfaction measure in GSS research [20]. It is of special interest in this study, as we wanted to know how satisfying the process of group interaction is when members are dispersed over time, space, organization, and national culture. Another issue that seems interesting in this situation is the participation of the virtual team members in the group work. We focus on team members' perception about participation, which has received considerable attention in GSS research [20].",Performance Measures Virtual Team Performance,,2,1,"Group members'

Also, project management can obtain slack in the system by descoping performance objectives to a more achievable level, negotiating less stringent deadlines, and obtaining additional resources for undertaking the project. Such project management activities, typically performed by the project manager, buffer the project from risk drivers and ensure that they are not significant to begin with.

It is also of increasing practical importance as the usage of IT becomes more pervasive. From a pragmatic point of view, understanding the determinants of information technology usage should help to ensure effective deployment of IT resources in an organization. Such usage is a necessary condition for ensuring productivity payoffs from IT investments (Davis 1989, Mathieson 1991.In recent years, a variety of theoretical perspectives have been advanced to provide an understanding ofthe determinants of usage. One important hne of research has employed intention-based models which use behavioral intention to predict usage and. in turn, focus on the identification ofthe determinants of intention, such as attitudes, social influences, and facilitating conditions (Davis etal. 1989(Davis etal. . 1992Hartwick and Barki 1994;Mathieson 1991). This work is grounded in models from social psychology, such as the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) {Ajzen and Fishbein 1980).and the Theory ofP]anncdBehavior(TPB) (Ajzen 1985(Ajzen , 1991.From this stream of research, the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) has emerged as a powerful and parsimonious way to represent the antecedents of system usage through beliefs about two factors: the perceived ease of use and the p>ereeived usefulness of an information system (Davis 1989(Davis , 1993Davis et al. 1989Davis et al. , 1992.",Abstract,,1,1,,,,False

The absence of a tripartite concept of ProU prevents readers from comprehending the actual meaning of ProU; consequently, how to reduce ProU systematically is still not understood. Drawing on related research, we theorize that ProU consists of three uncertainty dimensions to provide a comprehensive and foundational concept for future research. We contribute to the literature on ProU by first integrating these dimensions in one study. We further propose that if the recommendation sources can best reduce the three dimensions of ProU, then the likelihood for customers to accept these sources' recommendations is high.",Theoretical contributions,,2,1,,,,False

When environmental uncertainty is high, uncertainty with regard to requirements, technologies, and other critical aspects of software development is also high. In turn, this leads to incomplete information about methods that should be used to develop software, refiecting a low programmability of desirable behaviors. This follows the logic of Govindarajan and Fisher [23], who indicate that if the task environment of an organizational unit is uncertain, the task programmability for that unit is also low. Consequently, organizational attempts to preprogram behaviors are likely to be counterproductive [20, 51]. Hence, the control-through-process approach suggests that behavior controls are unlikely to be effective under uncertain conditions.

The raters used the meeting agendas (actual agendas rather than planned agendas) to determine the extent of process support, process structure, task support, and task structure used by each organization. One rater rated all cases. A second rater independently rated ten cases. The correlation between the two ratings was 0.95, so the first rater's ratings were used. Process support can be provided in three general ways, each of which may be used at different stages of the same meeting [38] . The smallest amount of GSS process support is delivered through the ""chauffeured"" meeting style. With this approach, all communication is verbal, with one person (typically a facilitator) recording information at a computer workstation that displays information on a video projection system so that all participants can see it; in this case, the GSS is an electronic version of a traditional flip chart, but with sophisticated modeling capabilities. GroupSystems tools that involved the chauffeured style were Issue Analyzer, Vote, Altemative Evaluator, and Policy Formation. An intermediate level of process support is provided via a ""supported"" meeting style, in which participants combine electronic communication with traditional verbal communication; participants use both the computer workstations and verbal conversation to discuss substantive issues. GroupSystems tools that incorporated the supported style were Idea Organizer and Stakeholder. The highest degree of process support is associated with an ""interactive"" meeting style, in which all participants communicate electronically via the computer workstations; participants send typed comments to other participants and no one talks. Interactive GroupSystems tools were Electronic Brainstorming and Topic Commenter.",Use of GSS capabilities ',,1,1,,,,False

First, we determined that participants in our study tend to access two or three recommendation sources (84% in Experiment 2 and 78% in Experiment 3) when making their choice decisions. Readers should be cautious in generalizing our results to all real-life contexts. Customers may not behave the same way and access more than one source when faced with an actual product decision situation (vs. the experimental setup). This finding is because the participants may know they were part of a study and might have adapted their behavior accordingly. However, for high involvement products (e.g., car or laptops), we expect customers would have the motivation to look at multiple sources from multiple websites before making a purchase. Thus, e-commerce merchants should provide their customers with multiple recommendation sources to reduce information asymmetry and ProU. With the rapid development of technology, customers are becoming increasingly overwhelmed by the amount of product information they receive. For example, an online retailer such as Amazon.com offers its customers over 18 million items. Given the sheer volume of information available on the Internet, customers may lack the time and effort to access complete information before making a product selection decision. Providing multiple online sources can help customers make highly informed product choices. More than 70% of the subjects in our study accessed more than one recommendation source. Hence, providing only one source may result in losing customers who prefer to access two or three sources. Customers might leave an online merchant that does not provide them with their preferred sources. This finding is an important yet often overlooked implication as few online vendors provide all three sources together.",Practical contributions,,0,0,,,,False

Researchers, such as Cox et al. [9] , Eisenhardt and Schoonhoven [16] , and McGrath [48] , argue that diversity gives rise to better performance. On the other hand, Ancona and Caldwell [2] , O'Reilly et al. [61] , and Smith et al.

Their argument assumes that homogeneity promotes trust and ease of communication. It is important to remember that much of the extant research in this area has examined face-to-face teams, and not much has been done to understand homogeneity and heterogeneity in virtual teams, especially those that may operate in an anonymous fashion.
