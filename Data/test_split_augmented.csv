These distinctions should become more pronounced as the relationship matures, because trusting beliefs differentiate with familiarity. The fact that the three ""faith in humanity"" subconstructs were more discriminant than the three trusting beliefs supports this. Subjects developed faith in general others' benevolence, competence, and integrity over a lifetime, making these more discriminant than trusting beliefs in a specific vendor, developed in one brief interaction with the vendor's Web site. In addition, the paper shows that these three attributes apply not only to the interpersonal domain, but also to the dispositional and institutional domains. That is, even when it comes to Internet vendors in general, people hold specific beliefs with respect to particular attributes rather than broadly trusting or not trusting. Furthermore, more than previous empirical trust studies, this work shows that trust constructs relate to each other in organized, meaningful ways. This is important because the word trust is commonly used to describe both detailed phenomena (e.g., ""I trust him to keep his promise."") and higher order phenomena (e.g., ""I just don't trust the Web."").",Discussion and Conclusions,,0.0,0.0,"Faith in general others’ benevolence.

's [34] criteria. First, IT supports for the three different types of strategies jointly determine a firm's overall IT support for strategies. Second, the three different types of strategies are completely different and their IT supports are also different. Third, IT supports for the three different types of strategies do not need to have covariation-for example, IT support for market differentiation strategy does not necessarily mean that IT will support the low-cost strategy. Finally, IT support for the three different types of strategies have different antecedents (e.g., IT functionalities) and consequences (e.g., strategic outcomes).IT can enable and support the realization of a firm's competitive strategy in many different ways. For example, IT can increase the entrance barrier of a specific market, enhance the bargaining power of suppliers and customers, supply the firm with new products and services, and even change the current competition rules [25,37,82,103].

As suggested above, subjects from the French subsample are considered to be more uncertainty avoidant than subjects of the U.S. subsample. Such an analysis could be criticized for not directly measuring the levels of uncertainty avoidance. However, we relied on previous work that indicates that Hofstede's detected differences still exist between France and the United States, although possibly at a lower level [39, 42, 81] . We measured culture in our study in a way consistent with many other studies involving the effects of culture, which are largely based on Hofstede, and which consider culture at the nation-state level [48, 78, 82] . Other competing conceptualizations suggest a value-based approach of culture at an individual level [78] .

The relative merits of various training programs are certainly debated in the literature. For example, proponents of classroom training claim that it is superior, since It is a cost effective way to train groups of people. Proponents of individual training methods, such as self-paced tutorials or computer-assisted instruction (CAI), claim that these methods are superior since they allow individuals to progress at their own pace. However, empirical evidence to support either of these claims is lacking. Recent studies by Bostrom et al. (1990) . Davis and Bostrom (1990) , Olfman and Bostrom (1990) , Sein and Bostrom (1989) , Martocchio and Webster (1992) , Webster and Martocchio (1993, forthcoming) and Webster et al.

For example, analysts may learn from a repository about related problems, similar symptoms, or other topics tbat have the same context of occurrence [22] . By helping analysts quickly identify and reject known solutions to problems, such repositories may improve their ability to delineate a problem and focus the scope of a potential solution. However, tbese repositories are not intended to reduce the collective problem-solving behaviors that analysts engage in when faced witb novel or unusual problems (e.g., [79] ). To tbe contrary, by enhancing analysts' efficiency in dealing with routine kinds of problems, such repositories may free up analysts' time to better deal with tbese more demanding kinds of novel problems. By carefully capturing knowledge in a searcbable IT-based repository, tecbnical support departments tbus stand to improve tbe efficiency of botb routine and nonroutine analyst's work in a variety of ways. Tbe result is what El Sawy and Bowles term more learningful technical support staff, meaning tbat tbey ""build on each other's knowledge and on tbat of more experienced senior colleagues and experienced customers"" [33, p. 474].",Abstract,,2.0,1.0,,,,0

Research within the Social Cognitive Theory paradigm has demonstrated that observing others performing a behavior (behavior modeling) is a powerful means of learning. Modeling has been used to teach new behaviors such as assertiveness (e.g.. Mann and Decker 1984) . It has also been used to teach skills such as mathematics (Schunk 1981) . selling skills (Meyer and Raich 1983) , supervisory skills (Latham and Saari 1979) and leadership (Manz and Sims 1986) and to overcome destructive phobias (Bandura 1982) . Moreover, a meta-analysis ofthe managerial training literature (Burke and Day 1986) demonstrated the effectiveness of behavior modeling training on both learning and subsequent behavior on the job. In spite of its application in other areas, only one study (Gist et al. 1989 ) has examined the role of behavior modeling in end-user software training.",Abstract,,12.0,1.0,,,,0

This variable was dichotomous: group type was considered either homogeneous or heterogeneous. Homogeneous groups were identified as those containing all Indian participants or all U,S, participants. Heterogeneous groups were a mixture of Indian and U,S, subjects as well as subjects from other countries studying at the U,S, university. Consistent with the time and other differences discussed above, the makeup of the homogeneous and heterogeneous groups was considered sufficiently rigorous. Only Indian subjects were members of the Indian homogenous groups, and with just two excepfions, only those born and living in the United States were members of the U,S, homogeneous groups. The two exceptions involved two students enrolled at the U.S, university who were not bom in the United States. However, each has attended more than one U,S. university, each has been in the United States for more than ten years, and both speak English as their primary language. Phinney [64] has indicated that language use is an accurate assessment tool for acculturation, which is the process by which an ethnic group gradually changes its behaviors and attitudes to be more like those of the host society [26], Smither and Rodriguez-Giegling [77] argued that factors such as social contacts, knowledge of host country language, length of time in a new country, and level of education are among the major facilitators of faster acculturation. Also, Goldlust and Richmond [25] have demonstrated that education and length of residence are the most important de-terminants of immigrant adaptation. Immigrants who reside in a host country for ten or more years were found to have greater levels of adaptation to the host country's way of life. Thus, all heterogeneous groups involved a mixture of students born and living in the United States and India or students attending the U.S. university who were from different backgrounds and cultures and had spent different lengths of time in the United States. All students who were members of the heterogeneous groups and who were not bom and raised in the United States had been in the United States for less than five years, with many just in their first year.",Variable Identification,,2.0,1.0,,,,0

( 3 ) human - related managerial it resources comprising governance structure of the it function and it professionals who possess managerial skills ; and ( 4 ) relational it resources comprising social capital arising from relationships between it function and other parties, including internal business functions and external vendors and consultants. it resources are conceptualized as a second - order formative construct based on jarvis et al.'s [ 34 ] criteria. first,, such as internally developing it applications and training employees how to use newly launched enterprise resource planning ( erp ) software. accumulating is necessary because the strategic factor market does not always provide a firm with all its required it resources. accumulating it resources enhances their insulating mechanisms for sustaining bvit creation. divesting refers to the shedding of firm - controlled it resources. under the context of limited and shrinking it investment, it is imperative that firms actively evaluate current it resources and divest less - valued it resources to generate the slack and flexibility needed to acquire or accumulate it resources for higher value. outsourcing it functions partially or totally can be seen as an example of divesting it resources. divesting contributes to bvit creation when it reduces the tangible or intangible cost of controlling specific it resources. resource structuring is critical to bvit creation because an it resource portfolio establishes the upper bounds of a firm's potential bvit creation. heterogeneity in it resources results from choices made in acquiring, accumulating, and divesting of it resources. at a certain point in time, the structure of a firm's it resources, including the aforementioned tangible, technical, managerial, and relational resources, is the outcome of the firm's earlier resource structuring activities. given that resource structuring is concerned with ongoing firm - level activities, it is difficult to measure in a cross - sectional manner. alternatively, by evaluating a firm's current it resources we can gain a reasonably clear understanding about how the firm has structured its it resources. many concepts which have been utilized in the is literature to describe it - related capabilities. a systematic literature review of leading is journals reveals the following four concepts. first, it - related capability is defined as the firmwide ability to acquire, deploy, and leverage it resources to help a firm achieve a competitive advantage and enhance firm performance [ 9, 93, 104 ]. second, it - related capability refers to the routines within the it function to execute is management and operational processes in a high - quality and sophisticated manner [ 69, 88, 89, 107 ]. third, it - related capability focuses mainly on the ability of the business function ( e. g., new product development ) to effectively use it functionalities [ 8, 72 ]. fourth, it - related capability is viewed as the ability of it affecting business processes and satisfying business requirements [ 38, 95 ]. integrating the previous conceptualizations, it capability in this paper is defined as a firm's ability to mobilize and deploy it resources effectively to perform strategic it planning, develop is, leverage and use is, and manage it function and it assets. it capability is not a simplistic one - dimensional concept ; rather, it is a complex construct composed of several dimensions. prior research highlights four important it 330 wang, liang, zhong, xue, and xiao capabilities : ( 1 ) it strategic planning capability, ( 2 ) it development capability, ( 3 ) it use capability, and ( 4 ) it management capability. it strategic planning capability reflects the sophistication of the it planning process, such as considering the effects of it on a firm's business strategies, analyzing deliberately the opportunity of it - based competitive advantage, selecting the appropriate is planning methodology, aligning is strategy with business strategy, and setting proper prioritization of the it application portfolio [ 10, 88 ]. is development capability pertains to the ability of developing and implementing is that satisfy business needs in a cost - effective and controlled manner [ 108 ]. is use capability refers to the ability to effectively use it functionalities, such as understanding why is are used, knowing what it functionalities are available, and being familiar with how to use these it functionalities [ 72 ]. it management capability refers to the ability to manage it - related issues such as it asset and cost, it staff development, and vendor relationships [ 10, 88 ]. these capabilities jointly determine a firm's overall it capabilities, and none of them should be overlooked. it is important to note that a firm's it capabilities are nontradable because they are home grown, highly customized, and impossible for a third party to develop without a deep understanding of specific attributes of the focal firm. it capabilities are conceptualized as a second - order formative construct based on jarvis et al.'s [ 34 ] criteria. first, a firm's different types of specific it capabilities jointly shape its overall it capabilities. second, the four types of specific it capabilities are distinct. for example, it strategic planning capabilities and it development capabilities are completely different and they cannot replace one another. third, the four types of specific it capabilities do not need to have covariation. for example, an increase in it strategic planning capabilities does not necessarily mean that it development capabilities will increase. finally, the four types of specific it capabilities have different antecedents and consequences. for example, cio ( chief information officer ) leadership may affect it strategic planning capabilities while the it staff's educational level may affect it development capabilities. under the resource - structuring mechanism, it resources can help firms gain competitive advantage and improve firm performance significantly when they enable and support the strategic - level organizational goal. firms have different effectiveness in structuring it resources that align with their competitive strategies and core competencies. for example, srivardhana and pawlowski [ 102 ] contend that the erp system, as an it resource, can enable business process innovation to create bvit. in contrast, the capability - building mechanism indicates that firms have different capabilities in using it resources to realize their strategic goals. under this mechanism, it capabilities, rather than it resources, are the principal reason that firms gain superior performance [ 95 ] and sustained competitive advantage [ 59, 94 ]. for example, sambamurthy et al. [ 93 ] assert it capabilities play an important role in increasing agility, which is crucial for innovation and firm performance under turbulent environments. the resource - structuring and capability - building mechanisms differ from each other in terms of the timing of value creation. the resource - structuring mechanism affects economic profit before the firm acquires, accumulates, and / or divests the selected resource. similar to makadok's [ 56 ] arguments, the resource - structuring mechanism an empirical study of business value of information technology 331 affects economic profit before the firm acquires or accumulates good resources whose price is lower than its marginal productivity or divests bad resources whose price is higher than their marginal productivity. in contrast, the capability - building mechanism affects economic profit only after the firm acquires resources whose productivity will be subsequently enhanced by the firm's capabilities. therefore, the two mechanisms have their impact at different phases of the it investment process - while resource structuring influences the decision phase, capability building influences the implementation and deployment phases [ 56 ]. for example, the resource - structuring mechanism helps a small accounting firm create profit by acquiring or developing a low - price, lightweight open source spreadsheet software instead of the more complicated excel ; and the capability - building mechanism helps a firm create profit by appropriately reconfiguring and customizing an erp system to meet its business requirements. environmental dynamismenvironmental dynamism refers to the rate and uncertainty of change in a firm's external environment [ 26 ]. firms in dynamic environments must be prepared to respond to unpredicted threats and opportunities to remain competitive. however, the instability of change in market demands, rivals'competitive actions, and technology development leads to an information deficit that reduces the firm's ability to manage resources to create value [ 98 ].""]",,,,,,,,1

Consistency of past behaviors helps trustors esti-mate the likelihood of desired future behaviors, and hence reduces uncertainty in transactional relationships [50] . The trustor's trust in the trustee continuously evolves with time as the trustor becomes familiar with the trustee's behavior, and hence familiarity fosters a process-based or relational trust among transacting parties. This process model of trust formation, developed via a temporal pattern of cooperative behavior, has been demonstrated analytically in game theoretic models using repeated decision games (for example [12] ).

It is clear that infonnation sharing and coordinationrelated knowledge are critical enablers, which enable change to be sensed and Breadth and Quality of Information Sharing with Supply Chain Partners. An ability to share information allows enterprises to sense the need for change in their current process configuration and develop mechanisms for dealing with change. Information sharing is tundamental to the learning required for deliberate change [42] , particularly in dynamic environments [47] . Information sharing is needed to a[[ow an enterprise to sense the needs of the partners and communicate its own needs to the partners. As an example, the director of logistics strategic planning at a manufacturer suggested, ""Information sharing is key to a dynamic supply chain like ours-we need to be able to track product as it moves through the chain and to extend this to channel partners and end customers. If we provide ASNs (advanced shipping notices) to our channel partners, they can be more efficient in receiving product.

Users can increase or decrease any rectangle's area gradually by placing the ""pump"" cursor into the area and pushing the mouse button (the left button inflates an area, the right button deflates). As a rectangle is inflating/deflating, other sibling rectangles that have the same parent will also deflate/ inflate and maintain their relative size ratio.

Second, our results indicated two positive moderating effects of social capital (cognitive and relational) on the well-known relationship between service quality and user satisfaction.

28315.0,28315_0,0.0,28315_0,0.0,28315_1,28315_1456_2991,ABSTRACT,"Therefore, IT resources include four key components: (1) tangible IT resources comprising physical IT infrastructure such as hardware, software, network, and data; (2) human-related technical IT resources comprising IT professionals who possess technical skills, knowledge, and experiences;(3) human-related managerial IT resources comprising governance structure of the IT function and IT professionals who possess managerial skills; and (4) relational IT resources comprising social capital arising from relationships between IT function and other parties, including internal business functions and external vendors and consultants.IT resources are conceptualized as a second-order formative construct based on jarvis et al. 's [34] criteria. First, , such as internally developing IT applications and training employees how to use newly launched enterprise resource planning (ERP) software. Accumulating is necessary because the strategic factor market does not always provide a firm with all its required IT resources. Accumulating IT resources enhances their insulating mechanisms for sustaining BVIT creation. Divesting refers to the shedding of firm-controlled IT resources. under the context of limited and shrinking IT investment, it is imperative that firms actively evaluate current IT resources and divest less-valued IT resources to generate the slack and flexibility needed to acquire or accumulate IT resources for higher value. Outsourcing IT functions partially or totally can be seen as an example of divesting IT resources. Divesting contributes to BVIT creation when it reduces the tangible or intangible cost of controlling specific IT resources.Resource structuring is critical to BVIT creation because an IT resource portfolio establishes the upper bounds of a firm's potential BVIT creation. Heterogeneity in IT resources results from choices made in acquiring, accumulating, and divesting of IT resources. At a certain point in time, the structure of a firm's IT resources, including the aforementioned tangible, technical, managerial, and relational resources, is the outcome of the firm's earlier resource structuring activities. given that resource structuring is concerned with ongoing firm-level activities, it is difficult to measure in a cross-sectional manner. Alternatively, by evaluating a firm's current IT resources we can gain a reasonably clear understanding about how the firm has structured its IT resources.Many concepts have been utilized in the IS literature to describe IT-related capabilities. A systematic literature review of leading IS journals reveals the following four concepts. First, IT-related capability is defined as the firmwide ability to acquire, deploy, and leverage IT resources to help a firm achieve a competitive advantage and enhance firm performance [9,93,104]. Second, IT-related capability refers to the routines within the IT function to execute IS management and operational processes in a high-quality and sophisticated manner [69,88,89,107]. Third, IT-related capability focuses mainly on the ability of the business function (e.g., new product development) to effectively use IT functionalities [8,72]. Fourth, IT-related capability is viewed as the ability of IT affecting business processes and satisfying business requirements [38,95].Integrating the previous conceptualizations, IT capability in this paper is defined as a firm's ability to mobilize and deploy IT resources effectively to perform strategic IT planning, develop IS, leverage and use IS, and manage IT function and IT assets. IT capability is not a simplistic one-dimensional concept; rather, it is a complex construct composed of several dimensions. Prior research highlights four important IT 330 WANg, LIANg, ZHONg, XuE, AND XIAO capabilities: (1) IT strategic planning capability, (2) IT development capability, (3) IT use capability, and (4) IT management capability. IT strategic planning capability reflects the sophistication of the IT planning process, such as considering the effects of IT on a firm's business strategies, analyzing deliberately the opportunity of IT-based competitive advantage, selecting the appropriate IS planning methodology, aligning IS strategy with business strategy, and setting proper prioritization of the IT application portfolio [10,88]. IS development capability pertains to the ability of developing and implementing IS that satisfy business needs in a cost-effective and controlled manner [108]. IS use capability refers to the ability to effectively use IT functionalities, such as understanding why IS are used, knowing what IT functionalities are available, and being familiar with how to use these IT functionalities [72]. IT management capability refers to the ability to manage IT-related issues such as IT asset and cost, IT staff development, and vendor relationships [10,88]. These capabilities jointly determine a firm's overall IT capabilities, and none of them should be overlooked. It is important to note that a firm's IT capabilities are nontradable because they are home grown, highly customized, and impossible for a third party to develop without a deep understanding of specific attributes of the focal firm.IT capabilities are conceptualized as a second-order formative construct based on jarvis et al. 's [34] criteria. First, a firm's different types of specific IT capabilities jointly shape its overall IT capabilities. Second, the four types of specific IT capabilities are distinct. For example, IT strategic planning capabilities and IT development capabilities are completely different and they cannot replace one another. Third, the four types of specific IT capabilities do not need to have covariation. For example, an increase in IT strategic planning capabilities does not necessarily mean that IT development capabilities will increase. Finally, the four types of specific IT capabilities have different antecedents and consequences. For example, CIO (chief information officer) leadership may affect IT strategic planning capabilities while the IT staff's educational level may affect IT development capabilities.under the resource-structuring mechanism, IT resources can help firms gain competitive advantage and improve firm performance significantly when they enable and support the strategic-level organizational goal. Firms have different effectiveness in structuring IT resources that align with their competitive strategies and core competencies. For example, Srivardhana and Pawlowski [102] contend that the ERP system, as an IT resource, can enable business process innovation to create BVIT. In contrast, the capability-building mechanism indicates that firms have different capabilities in using IT resources to realize their strategic goals. under this mechanism, IT capabilities, rather than IT resources, are the principal reason that firms gain superior performance [95] and sustained competitive advantage [59,94]. For example, Sambamurthy et al. [93] assert IT capabilities play an important role in increasing agility, which is crucial for innovation and firm performance under turbulent environments.The resource-structuring and capability-building mechanisms differ from each other in terms of the timing of value creation. The resource-structuring mechanism affects economic profit before the firm acquires, accumulates, and/or divests the selected resource. Similar to Makadok's [56] arguments, the resource-structuring mechanism AN EMPIRICAL STuDY OF BuSINESS VALuE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOgY 331 affects economic profit before the firm acquires or accumulates good resources whose price is lower than its marginal productivity or divests bad resources whose price is higher than their marginal productivity. In contrast, the capability-building mechanism affects economic profit only after the firm acquires resources whose productivity will be subsequently enhanced by the firm's capabilities. Therefore, the two mechanisms have their impact at different phases of the IT investment process-while resource structuring influences the decision phase, capability building influences the implementation and deployment phases [56]. For example, the resource-structuring mechanism helps a small accounting firm create profit by acquiring or developing a low-price, lightweight open source spreadsheet software instead of the more complicated Excel; and the capability-building mechanism helps a firm create profit by appropriately reconfiguring and customizing an ERP system to meet its business requirements. Environmental DynamismEnvironmental dynamism refers to the rate and uncertainty of change in a firm's external environment [26]. Firms in dynamic environments must be prepared to respond to unpredicted threats and opportunities to remain competitive. However, the instability of change in market demands, rivals' competitive actions, and technology development leads to an information deficit that reduces the firm's ability to manage resources to create value [98].",Abstract,,0.0,0.0,"Social capital arising from relationships between information technology function and other parties, including internal business functions and external vendors and consultants.",87.0,59995.0,1

Common-method variance is thought of as an additive effect, a type of correlated error that is part of both of the measures involved in the estimate of a relationship (such as between X and Y; [80] ). Because all the data were obtained from one executive per organization, concerns might arise regarding spuriously high correlations [3] , In anticipation of this problem, we used a scenariodriven design that manipulated one of the independent variables (SSD) rather than rely on respondent reports about the independent variable. Because common-method variance (overly consistent responses) would tend to obscure within-subject differences, but a significant within-subject effect was found instead, the findings from Hypothesis 1 cannot be attributed to respondents' personal perceptual biases. In addition, we proposed and found interactive relationships between firm characteristics and SSD, Common-method variance cannot explain higher-order or moderating effects of X and Z on Y [80] , Therefore, the significant interactive effect reported cannot be attributed to common-method variance [26] ,",Limitations,,5.0,1.0,,,,0

This result lends further support to prior literature that came to similar conclusions [86, p. 90]. However, beyond confirming prior research results in this nascent research area, this study elucidates several possible relevant antecedents to the conceptualization of trust in the IT artifact. Our results demonstrate that trust in the IT artifact is directly influenced by system quality characteristics-that is, navigational structure and visual appeal. This is an important conclusion because it identifies aspects of trust in the IT artifact that are unique and different from attributes related to trust in people. Thus, this research addresses the call for research in Wang and Benbasat to ""examine whether the conceptualization of trust in IT artifacts should be extended to include other relevant beliefs"" [86, p. 90]. Using these findings, researchers of trust in IT artifacts should be better able to conceptualize and model trust in IT artifacts.

In tCE literature, such uncertainty is referred to as primary uncertainty in the transaction environment [57, 62]. 4 Since ASPs deliver It services over the Internet, a critical aspect of the ASP service is to ensure reliability, guaranteed availability, and application response. however, ASPs have no control over the application code, the peering points of a network, third-party service performance, and the performance of the Internet. Further, an ASP may not invest sufficiently in reliability or quality of service, and blame the Internet infrastructure for what is essentially nonperformance by the ASP. thus, there is also a risk of shirking in that the ASP may undersupply quality of service [61] . In both cases, an organization outsourcing to an ASP may be unable to access critical applications. ASPs offer a service-level agreement (SlA) with a predefined minimum performance; for instance, offering 99 percent reliability and guaranteeing service delivery that is considered acceptable. when the ASP cannot deliver the service agreed upon, the SlA carries with it a built-in penalty such as a payment to compensate the end user for downtime and loss of business [51] that can address some of the concerns regarding shirking. when it is difficult to anticipate ex ante the stream of services required from the ASP, time and materials contracts make it easier to compensate the ASP for business needs that are not foreseen initially. however, concerns about ASPs' ability to manage the pay per usage billing and overcharging customers impeded the adoption of time and materials contracts. Anecdotal evidence indicates that poorly designed contracts led to considerable dissatisfaction among early users of ASP services [31].",Abstract,,4.0,1.0,,,,0

Given that biometric identity authentication is a relatively new innovation, most consumers are at the knowledge stage, where there is general awareness that the innovation exists. Having sufficient knowledge (i.e., familiarity) about a new innovation shapes an individual's beliefs about its utility (i.e., benefits) (Straub 2009 ), which is critical to moving to the next stage of acceptance (i.e., persuasion 2 ). Hence, consumers who have higher familiarity with biometric technologies for identity authentication will be in a better position to realize the benefits of account security and convenience that accrue from the use of this technology at ATMs. Thus, we hypothesize the following: Hypothesis 3A. Familiarity with biometric technologies will positively influence one's perceptions of bank account security when bank accounts are accessed through ATMs using biometric identity authentication.",Hypothesis 4 .

's [ 34 ] standard . first , , such as internally development information technology application and training employee how to use newly establish enterprise resource planning ( ERP ) software . roll up is necessity because the strategic factor market does not always supply a firm with all its necessitate IT resource . roll up information technology resource enhance their insulate mechanism for prolong BVIT creation . deprive mention to the shedding of firm - control IT resource . under the context of express and shrinking IT investing , it is imperative mood that firm actively measure current IT resource and deprive less - value IT resource to generate the slack and flexibility necessitate to get or roll up IT resource for higher value . outsource information technology function partially or wholly can be see as an example of deprive information technology resource . deprive lend to BVIT creation when it reduce the tangible or intangible cost of control particular information technology resource . resource structure is critical to BVIT creation because an IT resource portfolio establish the upper berth boundary of a firm 's potential BVIT creation . heterogeneity in IT resource consequence from choice make in acquiring , roll up , and deprive of IT resource . At a certain point in time , the structure of a firm 's IT resource , include the aforesaid tangible , technical , managerial , and relational resource , is the result of the firm 's earlier resource structure activity . given that resource structure is refer with ongoing firm - degree activity , it is difficult to measure in a cross - sectional manner . alternatively , by measure a firm 's current IT resource we can addition a reasonably clear understanding about how the firm has structure its IT resource . many concept have been use in the IS literature to describe information technology - associate capability . A systematic literature reappraisal of lead IS diary uncover the following four concept . first , IT - associate capability is specify as the firmwide ability to get , deploy , and leverage IT resource to aid a firm achieve a competitive advantage and enhance firm performance [ 9,93,104 ] . second , IT - associate capability mention to the routine within the information technology function to execute IS management and operational procedure in a high - quality and sophisticate manner [ 69,88,89,107 ] . one-third , IT - associate capability focus chiefly on the ability of the business function ( for example , new merchandise development ) to efficaciously use IT functionality [ 8,72 ] . fourth , IT - associate capability is see as the ability of information technology affect business procedure and satisfy business requirement [ 38,95].Integrating the previous conceptualization , IT capability in this paper is specify as a firm 's ability to mobilize and deploy information technology resource efficaciously to perform strategic information technology planning , develop IS , leverage and use IS , and pull off IT function and information technology assets . information technology capability is not a simplistic one - dimensional concept ; rather , it is a complex concept compose of several dimension . prior research highlight four important IT 330 WANg , LIANg , ZHONg , XuE , AND XIAO capability : ( 1 ) information technology strategic planning capability , ( 2 ) IT development capability , ( 3 ) IT use capability , and ( 4 ) IT management capability . information technology strategic planning capability reflect the edification of the IT planning procedure , such as see the effects of information technology on a firm 's business scheme , analyze intentionally the opportunity of IT - establish competitive advantage , choose the allow IS planning methodology , align IS scheme with business scheme , and setting proper prioritization of the IT application portfolio [ 10,88 ] . IS development capability refer to the ability of development and implement IS that satisfy business need in a cost - effective and control manner [ 108 ] . IS use capability mention to the ability to efficaciously use IT functionality , such as understanding why IS are use , knowing what IT functionality are available , and being familiar with how to use these IT functionality [ 72 ] . information technology management capability mention to the ability to pull off information technology - associate issue such as IT asset and cost , IT staff development , and seller relationship [ 10,88 ] . These capability jointly determine a firm 's overall IT capability , and none of them should be overlook . It is important to note that a firm 's IT capability are nontradable because they are home turn , highly custom-make , and impossible for a one-third party to develop without a deep understanding of particular property of the focal firm . IT capability are gestate as a second - order formative concept establish on jarvis et al . 's [ 34 ] standard . first , a firm 's different type of particular IT capability jointly shape its overall IT capability . second , the four type of particular IT capability are distinct . For example , IT strategic planning capability and IT development capability are wholly different and they can not replace one another . one-third , the four type of particular IT capability do not need to rich person covariation . For example , an addition in IT strategic planning capability does not necessarily mean that IT development capability will addition . finally , the four type of particular IT capability rich person different ancestor and consequence . For example , CIO ( head information military officer ) leadership may affect IT strategic planning capability while the IT staff 's educational degree may affect IT development capabilities.under the resource - structure mechanism , IT resource can aid firm addition competitive advantage and better firm performance significantly when they enable and support the strategic - degree organizational goal . firm rich person different effectiveness in structure IT resource that align with their competitive scheme and core competence . For example , Srivardhana and Pawlowski [ 102 ] contend that the ERP system , as an IT resource , can enable business procedure invention to make BVIT . In contrast , the capability - building mechanism bespeak that firm rich person different capability in exploitation IT resource to recognize their strategic goal . under this mechanism , IT capability , rather than IT resource , are the principal reason that firm addition superior performance [ 95 ] and prolong competitive advantage [ 59,94 ] . For example , Sambamurthy et al . [ 93 ] assert IT capability play an important function in increase agility , which is crucial for invention and firm performance under disruptive environment . The resource - structure and capability - building mechanism differ from each other in footing of the timing of value creation . The resource - structure mechanism affect economic net income before the firm get , roll up , and/or deprive the choose resource . similar to Makadok 's [ 56 ] argument , the resource - structure mechanism AN EMPIRICAL survey OF BuSINESS value OF information technology 331 affect economic net income before the firm get or roll up good resource whose monetary value is lower berth than its fringy productiveness or deprive bad resource whose monetary value is higher than their fringy productiveness . In contrast , the capability - building mechanism affect economic net income lone after the firm get resource whose productiveness will be subsequently enhance by the firm 's capability . therefore , the two mechanism rich person their impact at different phase of the IT investing procedure - while resource structure influence the decision phase , capability building influence the execution and deployment phase [ 56 ] . For example , the resource - structure mechanism aid a small accounting firm make net income by acquiring or development a low - monetary value , lightweight open beginning spreadsheet software alternatively of the More complicate Excel ; and the capability - building mechanism aid a firm make net income by appropriately reconfiguring and custom-make an ERP system to meet its business requirement . Environmental DynamismEnvironmental dynamism mention to the rate and uncertainty of change in a firm 's external environment [ 26 ] . firm in moral force environment must be fix to react to unannounced menace and opportunity to stay competitive . however , the instability of change in market demand , rival ' competitive action , and technology development lead to an information deficit that reduce the firm 's ability to pull off resource to make value [ 98 ] .",,,,,,,,1

Culture affects almost all of the mental programs of individuals (e.g., attitudes, personality, satisfaction, perception, and so on), which in turn are reflected by our behavior [29]. Thus, the collective effort, member interaction, and level of success achieved by a virtual team would be expected to be influenced by the behaviors exhibited by the team members. The values of individualism-collectivism and how strongly or weakly they are adhered to by the members of a virtual team will contribute to how much of the collaborative conflict management style might develop in the team. We expect that a higher proclivity toward individualism would lead to weaker tendencies by members to be collaborative in their attitude toward intrateam conflict. Trubisky et al. [85] found that members from collectivistic cultures used collaborative conflict resolution style more often than members from individualistic cultures. Individualists are more concerned about their own interest and less about the interests of the entire group. Wagner [90] reported that in group discussions, individualistic members who place high emphasis on self-independence are less likely to engage in cooperative behavior, whereas collectivist members who value interdependence among group members are more likely to be cooperative in their behavior. Therefore, Hypothesis 1: In a GSS-based global virtual team, members' proclivities toward individualism-collectivism will operate in such a way that the higher the level of individualism, the lower will be the overall level of collaborative conflict management style prevailing in the team.",Individualism - Collectivism and Collaborative Conflict Management Style,,2.0,1.0,,,,0
